> A complete toolkit for bridging the world of GSM communication with modern web technologies. This ESP8266-based gateway is specifically designed to automate interactive USSD services, making it a powerful tool for fintech applications, mobile money management, and IoT automation.

## üé¨ Project Walkthrough: From Setup to Full Operation

This section provides a live, step-by-step demonstration of the gateway's core functionalities.

### **Step 1: First-Time Setup & Configuration**

> The gateway is designed for a seamless out-of-the-box experience. On first boot, it enters Access Point mode, creating its own Wi-Fi network. The user can connect, and a captive portal automatically opens the configuration page to connect the device to a local network.

### **Step 2: Live USSD Interactive Session**

> The core feature of the gateway. The UI provides a dedicated, session-aware form to handle complex, multi-step USSD interactions. This is ideal for automating financial services like balance checks or money transfers from e-wallets.

### **Step 3: Live SMS Demo (Unicode & Real-time)**

> The gateway has a full-featured SMS interface with a robust backend PDU encoder, providing full support for Unicode (Arabic) characters. All interactions are pushed to the UI in real-time via WebSockets.

## üåü About The Project: A Vision for Accessible Innovation

> As a software engineer with a passion for bridging the gap between low-level protocols and high-level applications, I thrive on tackling the challenges that lie at the intersection of technology and accessibility. This project emerged from a singular vision: **to harness the power of USSD-based financial services, making them more accessible, automated, and seamlessly integrated with contemporary web systems.**

In many developing regions, USSD serves as the backbone of mobile money and e-wallet platforms, such as **Vodafone Cash**. However, interacting with these services programmatically can often be cumbersome and overly complex. To address this, I created the **Smart GSM Gateway**‚Äîa comprehensive solution designed to simplify and automate these interactions.

It‚Äôs more than just an SMS gateway; it‚Äôs a **robust, self-contained platform** that enables developers and businesses to build scalable applications that leverage existing GSM infrastructure.

This project stands as a testament to how thoughtful software design can elevate simple hardware into a powerful tool for **innovation and progress**.

## üéØ Primary Use Cases

- **Fintech & Mobile Money Automation:** Directly interact with and automate services like Vodafone Cash, M-Pesa, etc. Build bots for balance checks, money transfers, and service subscriptions.
- **IoT & M2M Communication:** Use SMS as a reliable, low-bandwidth communication channel for remote devices, sensors, and security alerts.
- **Remote System Management:** Deploy a gateway in a remote location and manage it entirely through its web interface, checking signal quality and network status without physical access.

## ‚ú® Key Features

- **üì± Interactive USSD at its Core:** A session-aware web form designed specifically to handle complex, multi-step USSD menus, making automation simple and intuitive.
- **üí¨ Advanced SMS & PDU Engine:** Full support for sending and receiving messages in both **GSM-7 (English)** and **UCS-2 (Arabic)**, thanks to a robust backend PDU encoder/decoder.
- **üì° Real-time Control via WebSockets:** Every action and status update is pushed to the web interface instantly, providing a responsive and modern user experience.
- **üìû Caller ID Notification:** The gateway detects incoming calls and displays the caller's number in the UI.
- **‚öôÔ∏è Resilient Non-Blocking Backend:** Built with asynchronous state machines in C++ to ensure the gateway remains stable and responsive, even when dealing with unpredictable network latency or unexpected AT command responses.
- **üåê Dual-Mode & Multilingual:** A self-hosting Access Point for easy setup and a multilingual (AR/EN) Station Mode for daily use.

## üîå Hardware Setup & Schematic

The hardware setup is minimal and designed for easy replication.

![Wiring Diagram](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/anasalhawija/Smart-GSM-Gateway/main/assets/SmartGSMGateway-PinConnectionSchematic.gif)

1.  **Pin Connections:**

    - `ESP8266 Pin D2 (GPIO4)` ‚Üí `GSM Module TX`
    - `ESP8266 Pin D1 (GPIO5)` ‚Üí `GSM Module RX`
    - `ESP8266 GND` ‚Üí `GSM Module GND` (Ensure a common ground)

2.  **Basic Schematic (ASCII Art):**
    ```
         +---------------------+        +------------------+
         |     NodeMCU         |        |   SIM/GSM Module |
         |       ESP8266       |        |      (SIM900A)   |
         |                     |        |                  |
         |   D2 (GPIO4) Tx  >--|------->| Rx               |
         |   D1 (GPIO5) Rx  <--|-------<| Tx               |
         |                     |        |                  |
         |           GND    <--|------->| GND              |
         +---------------------+        +------------------+
    ```
    **Crucial Power Note:** The SIM900A module is power-hungry. It **must** be powered by its own stable 5V 2A power supply. Do not attempt to power it from the NodeMCU's pins.
